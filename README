QuickLaunch@github.com

= DESCRIPTION =

This extension adds a popup menu to the top bar of gnome-shell.

If you have any custom launchers, for example from a previous version of gnome-panel, or from your desktop, you can use the new popup to start these.

To populate the popup menu, put .desktop files into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch/

= INSTALL =

1. Put this folder below ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and rename it to QuickLaunch@github.com

2. create ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch and put a few .desktop files in there

  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch/

3. reload gnome-shell (press alt-f2, enter r)

4. use gnome-tweak-tool to enable the new shell extension
